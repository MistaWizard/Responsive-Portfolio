            <p class="bio">Born in 1984 in the bustling metropolis of Kettering, Ohio, I've always enjoyed electronics, video games, and technology. My original plan upon graduating high school was to attend college for computer related studies. I decided to take a career diversion and attended the International College of Broadcasting in Dayton, Ohio for audio engineering.</p>
            <p class="bio">After getting married, moving to Cleveland and raising a 10 year old and 3 year old in the past 11 years, I've decided to get back to what I love and explore a career in the technology industry. After graduating from the Case Wertern Reserve University Coding Boot Camp, I'll have the skills and experience needed to help you complete your web project.</p>
